A prediction plugin that provides and aims to solve the problem of a unified client prediction & rollback netcode solution for movement and ability systems in Unreal Engine.

**Core Philosophy**: Replace UE's fragmented prediction systems with a single authoritative framework used by:
- [GameplayMovementPlugin](https://github.com/KhxiSaki/GameplayMovementPlugin) (Movement Prediction)
- [GameplayAbilities](https://github.com/KhxiSaki/GameplayAbilities) (Ability System Prediction)

## Project Vision üéØ
**Create a unified prediction backbone** that bridges:
- Character Movement Component (CMC) prediction patterns
- GameplayAbilities prediction system
- New Network Prediction/Mover plugin approaches
- Chaos physics prediction requirements
